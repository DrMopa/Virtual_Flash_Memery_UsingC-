The memory is broken up into sectors that can be erased as a single block, mimicking the deletion process of a standard Flash memory module. Ideally this can be used to further test file structures to ensure comparability with the constraints imposed by physical media.

The Driver level can be implemented directly on top of this foundation, which is a project that has sadly been put on hold, but may be resurrected one day.

If youâ€™re interested in the theoretical Flash memory management driver of ours, Email me for further details.
